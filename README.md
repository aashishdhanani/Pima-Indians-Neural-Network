# Pima-Indians-Neural-Network

Thank you to Adrian Tam for helping with the walkthrough on this project. Also, thank you to Jason Brownlee for providing the dataset used in this project.

This is a simple neural network (using pytorch) to predict whether or not the Pima Indians have had an onset of diabetes within 5 years. Code is as follows:

    1. Loading Data
    2. Defining the Model
    3. Preparing for Training
    4. Training
    5. Evaluation
